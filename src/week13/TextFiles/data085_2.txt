Alice was tired of sitting with her sister.
She had nothing to do.
She peeked into her sister's book.
It had no pictures.
"What use is a book," thought Alice, "without pictures?"
She felt sleepy in the hot sun.
She considered making a daisy chain.
Suddenly, a White Rabbit with pink eyes ran by.
The Rabbit looked at his watch.
Then, he hurried away.
